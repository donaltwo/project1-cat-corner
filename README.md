# Cat Corner

# Introduction 

Welcome to Cat Corner a website dedicated to lovers of cats and coffee! I used my own two cats Diablo and Persephone and built a website around them. The site's audience if for anyone who likes cats and relaxation.

# Preparation Phase
I began by brainstorming the concept and creating a wire frame on Figma for the skeleton for the website.
![Figma mock up of home page with cat and coffee](https://github.com/donaltwo/project1-cat-corner/assets/155965788/21eecd58-f5ef-4bfa-b80a-ebd80ca89caa)

The audience for my website is for cat loving adults so I wanted to achieve a sleek and robust website.
I decided on the colours black white and purple for the design element for a nice contrast and style.
I collected images for the website and took a video for the background.

# Features 
1. **Nav Bar**

The confirmation page plays a looped muted video.

# Testing
To highlight an initial misunderstanding of mine as this was my first time using Github was that I would make very minor changes, fixing a typo, coding a single line etc. and would save committed the changes and push to see the effected changes reflected in my local copy of the website.
This is why there is over 260+ commits present on the website, I wanted to make note of it as a rookie error that I've learnt from.

# Known Issues
Due to this being my first ever website project I struggled with coding and the design aspects. I have learnt a lot from this however there are still present issues on the website if I had additional time I would focus on solving.
- [] Hero text not showing correctly.
- [] Website scaling on mobile isn't optimal.


# Deployment
I published the Github page with my website thus deployimng the website to be live.

#  Media
All the images and video were taken by myself Donal Twomey and therefore my own works that are displayed.
