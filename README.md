Introduction
Cat Corner
Welcome to Cat Corner a website dedicated to lovers of cats and coffee! I used my own two cats Diablo and Persephone and built a website around them. The site's audience if for anyone who likes cats and relaxation.

Prepation Phase
I began by brainstorming the concept and creating a wire frame on Figma for the skeleton for the website.
![Figma mock up of home page with cat and coffee](https://github.com/donaltwo/project1-cat-corner/assets/155965788/21eecd58-f5ef-4bfa-b80a-ebd80ca89caa)

The audience for my website is for cat loving adults so I wanted to achieve a sleek and robut website.
I decided on the colours black white and purple for the design element for a nice contrast and style.
I collected images for the website and took a video for the background.

Testing
To highlight an initial misunderstanding of mine as this was my first time using Github was that I would make very minor changes, fixing a typo, coding a single line etc and would save committed the changes and push to see the effected changes reflected in my local copy of the website.
This is why there is over 250+ commits present on the website, I wanted to make note of it as a rookie error that I've learnt from.
