Welcome to my first project for Code Institute.
Included is a three page website fitting the brief for a fictional cat cafe based in Cork. My auidience is for people who enjoy cats and cafes.
Features include a home page with buttons, gallery page, a booking page with a form and a FAQ page with more information.

Prepation Phase
I began by brainstorming the concept and creating a wire frame on Figma for the skeleton for the website.
The audience for my website is for cat loving adults so I wanted to ahcieve a sleek and robut website.
I decided on the colours black and purple for the design element for a nice contrast and style.
I collected images for the website and took a video for the background.
