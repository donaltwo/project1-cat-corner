Welcome to my first project for Code Institute.
Included is a three page website fitting the brief for a fictional cat cafe based in Cork.
Features include a home page with buttons, gallery page, a booking page with a form and a FAQ page with more information.

Prepation Phase
I began by brainstorming the concept and creating a wire frame on Figma for the skeleton for the website.
The audience for my website is for cat loving adults so I wanted to ahcieve a sleek and robut website.

Version 1.0

*Found images to use as placeholders*

*Made a home button.
